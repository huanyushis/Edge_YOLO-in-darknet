# Edge YOLO in darknet
The edge computing neural network based on Darknet is easy to be deployed at the edge and has high accuracy.We can easily use edgeyolo for mask detection
## Get Started
Training
We used AlexeyAB's Darknet train our model.
Install Darknet here.
```
https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet.git
```
## Dataset
Download our mask dataset or Coco dataset for training
```
https://github.com/huanyushis/Face-mask-set.git
```
## Change type
Use scripts to convert data sets into data that can be recognized by Darknet(Don't forget to modify the address information!)
```
python3 voc_label_mask.py
```
## Training

Now you need to install step by step according to the installation method of Darknet, and use our cfg file as they do.
